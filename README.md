## About
In this repository you will find only my solutions for all these exercises. 
It's not the best way to do it or the best option to base it on, 
it's just the way I managed to solve them.

## Algorithms
These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms
that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic
and programming skills.
These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. [fcc]

## Data Structures
These free programming courses are meant to help you deal with large and complex data structures
that you may not yet be familiar with. [fcc]

## Rosetta Code
There are a total of 160 exercises and so that the readme file is not too long,
I will separate this section into a table and a separate file for better organization of the content.

[**Click here to access the Rosetta Code exercises** 😄](rosetta-code.md)

## Take Home Projects
Programming interviews have always been stressful. Job applicants are sometimes given a take home project
to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work,
but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job. [fcc]
